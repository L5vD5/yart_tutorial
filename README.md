# Yet Another Robotics Tutorial

It contains
- Coordinate transforms 
- Building a kinematic chain from scratch
- Parsing a kinematic chain from universal robot description format (URDF) files
- Forward Kinematics 
- Inverse Kinematics 
- Null space projected IK 
- Checking self-collisions with capsule representations 


Most of the codes are built from the scratch, mainly for education purposes (Yes, codes are not fully optimized).
