# Tutorial of Yet Another Robotics Toolbox (YART)

It contains
- Show and control of some robots
- Basic position, rotation, Coordinates
- Coordinate Transformations
- Coordinate Transformations (the second perspectives)
- Angular velocity vector $\omega$
- Convert R <=> w using Rodrigues' formula
- Interpolate rotation matrics using Rodrigues' formula
- Translate and rotate objects in 3D space
- Construct the kinematic chain
- Numerical inverse kinematics with Jacobian
- Inverse Kinematics with Interactive Marker
- Nullspace projected IK with joint space target
- Nullspace projected IK with task space target


Most of the codes are built from the scratch, mainly for education purposes (Yes, codes are not fully optimized). 

Full version of YART will be released via separate repo.
