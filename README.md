# Tutorial of Yet Another Robotics Toolbox (YART)

It contains
- Coordinate transforms 
- Building a kinematic chain from scratch
- Parsing a kinematic chain from universal robot description format (URDF) files
- Forward Kinematics 
- Inverse Kinematics 
- Null space projected IK 
- Checking self-collisions with capsule representations 


Most of the codes are built from the scratch, mainly for education purposes (Yes, codes are not fully optimized). 

Full version of YART will be released via separate repo.
